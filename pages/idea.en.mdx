# About ideas

## How do we define a good idea?

A good idea often comes with two characteristics as following:

### 1. Begin with the problem itself rather than the solution

When you try to make a side project, you can make time-saving and beneficial things without failure, starting with the problem. 

### 2. Pay attention to your own issue

It's a common reason for the dead projects that the author isn't motivated. You can be charged up by solving your own problem. 

The following questions will provide you with deeper understanding of your project and a check of your idea. **It's never too late to begin after solving these problems**. 

## Self-test Form

1. Who're the target users of the project?

2. What's the cause of users' dissatisfaction? If they see your project, will they say: "Oh, thank you. I wish this had appeared sooner. "? 

3. What contributions do you do to them with your project? 

4. Write an article of an imagined user to describe the project and how much help it brings to users.

5. Consider a title for your blog. Is the idea new enough for the target users to click on it and share it even after days of using? 

6. What is your target users' criteria for measuring good or bad? Can your project stand out under this standard? (What's the difference between your project and others'? )

## How to come up with a good idea? 

My suggestion is to maintain a list of ideas, and record the problems and ideas that you usually think of. Good ideas and good pain points will stimulate you repeatedly and you will finally manage to think of a good idea. 

## Researches on Competitive Projects

There are always countless numbers of brains trying to find questions to solve, so your idea is rarely that unique. You can refer to existing solutions and thinking over why they succeeded or not, and why others will choose your projects instead.

I usually use the following platforms to find out the competitive projects:

- [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/)
- [Google](https://google.com)
