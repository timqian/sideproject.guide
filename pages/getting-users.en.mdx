## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Publishing and sharing your product is the way you find your users, but searching is the way users locate you. Although the short-term effects don't come so instantly as sharing it yourself, on account of the [Long Tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail), provided the SEO to be done has been well done, the users coming from Search Engines will outnumber those you obtain by sharing. Moreover, they need your product more.

SEO has at one time been an advanced task, for many tricks have been invented to deceive the Search Engine so as to help the website to rank higher. However, the value of a Search Engine lies in its aid to users **when it comes to finding what they want**. The game between search engines and SEO adopters has lasted for so many years, during which time countless tricks have failed and such abilities of search engines have been greatly improved. 

For you yourself, the most important is to accuratly write the introduction to your product and leave everything else to Google. It might not be a worthwhile investment toight a battle of wits and courage

- Have your link shown on more high-quality websites
- Help the search engine better locate your content and properly show it to users.
  - the title tag(`<title/>`)ï¼štells users and the search engine what the website is about
  - the description tag(`<meta name="description"/>`): search engines may use this as the abstract of your website
- Using brief but descriptive words as the link text (the visible part of the link). Such texts tell users and the search engine information on the website that is linked to.
- Use filenames and alternative texts (the `alt` attribute of the `image` tag) that make sense for images: this enables the search engines for images (e.g. Google Images) to better make sense of your images and can be another source of views.
- Build websites suitable for mobile devices, for many searches are made on mobiles. Google has started its attempt to implement [mobile-first indexing](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/11/mobile-first-indexing.html), namely using the contents of mobile websites as a priority for ranking and parsing. If the mobile website lacks satisfying searching experiences, the rank of it will be lowered. And here's a tool made by Google for you to *[check whether your website is mobile-friendly](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)*

## The Self-growth property

The best self-growth property of the product itself helps users, and all the other tricks are just icing on the cake.

Here're some tricks:

- Rewards for invitation: which promotes sharing
- Hunger Marketing: Adopting the invitation code mechanism
- Increase user stickiness: establish a chat group
- Building user confidence: long-term updates

## The Importance of Continuous Improvement

Few products are made to look their best. Continuous Improvement has two benefits:

- Look for the product market fit: very few products have been made to meet the needs of many people
- Continuous improvement gives users confidence
