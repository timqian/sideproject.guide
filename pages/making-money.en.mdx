# How to Earn Money with Side Project

As a normal equal-value thing, price is used for measuring the value of an object or a service. As long as your side project helps some people, no matter if it is paid, it is of value.

## Common Strategy of Migrating Side Project to Paid Service

1. When your product isn't known by others or ready to use, provide users free. (But you'd better tell them it won't be free forever, in order to give them a mental expectation)
2. Improve your product according to early users' feedback to accumulate initial users.
3. When the product comes stable enough and has enough users, find a reasonable pricing method and republish it. At this time, the possibility of publishing and paid conversion rate comes higher.

## Charging Tools

It might be much too tiring to access the payment system. For instance, you may be unwilling to spend two days on Stripe, you only spend two days on your side project after all! 

But you should at least think of **accepting sponsers**. The only thing you need to do is to attach the sponser link to your side project.

I still remember the joy when my side project first received sponsorship after so many years, it was a feeling that what you did was really recognized.

Some Commonly-used Sponser Platforms:

- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) (Worldwide)
- [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/) (Worldwide)
- [BuyMeACoffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/) (Worldwide)
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/?) (Worldwide)
- [AF-Dian](https://afdian.net/) (China)
- Payment QR Code in Wechat/Alipay (China)

If your side project receives sponsorship, it is an affirmation of his value. When you make it more useful, it provides users with greater value. If you want to make it a "Major Project", you can choose the following payment systems: 

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) (Worldwide, Hong Kong or international bank card needed, Low rates)
- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) (Worldwide, Available in China, Easy set-up)
